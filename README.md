# Password-Generator

##Description

Given some boilerplate code for a password generator, I have created a function that will generate a password based off the users needs and given a set of criteria. The generated password is checked to see whether it meets the users criteria. The users input is validated to ensure they have entered as number, when they are asked for the length they require their password to be, and that they are selecting at least one character type they wish their password to be. 

##Installation

No installation needed. The code is deployed as a stand alone page on Git Pages, (https://karra-ormsby.github.io/Password-Generator/).

##Usage

This website is a password generator. The user is presented with a generate password application ![image of password generator application](./assets/images/Image%20of%20password%20generator.png).


To generate a password the user must click on the generate password button,

 ![generate password buttton](./assets/images/Image%20of%20button.png)

and after answering a series of prompts that display on the screen, a password will be outputed in the textbox
